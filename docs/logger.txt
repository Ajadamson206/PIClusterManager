The Project introduces a Syslog compatible logging system that uses 4 main levels...
    Debug: No Severity, logs byte buffers and when data is successfully added

    
    Warning: Low Severity, examples include mismatched data coming from the clients
    
    Error: Medium Severity, The program still continues to run, but could eventually lead to undefined behaviors if it goes on for too long
    
    Critical: High Severity, Something is preventing the program from executing further and the program crashed.
        Examples-Invalid Permissions for the database

Different Log Levels could be hidden depending on the input parameter passed into the program
    See configFile.txt for more information

Development Notes:
    It is suggested that the logger is to be used rather than the conventional print statement

    This helps users control the amount of information that they want to see
